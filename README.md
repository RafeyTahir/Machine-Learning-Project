## Overview
This project implements 4 algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression. The KNN algorithm classifies new data points based on the 'k' closest neighbors in the training dataset, similarly all algorithm that aims to learn a linear transformation of the features to better separate data points of different classes.
